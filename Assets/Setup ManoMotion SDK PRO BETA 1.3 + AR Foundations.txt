Common Issues & Solutions:
1)When importing the ManoMotion package, the prefabs appear to be missing.
    (Solution) Set your unity project to a version greater to 2018.3 
2)The application does not work and I am receiving a message of BundleIdentifier Missmatch.
    (Solution) Make sure that there are no spaces or additional characters in your license key(Check step 2) field or Bundle Identifier(Check step 4). 
3)The application does not work and I am receiving a message of Internet Required.
    (Solution) Make sure that the internet speed of your phone is adequate to communicate with our service. This issue is faced when there is either 
        a) No internet connection available in the device. 
        b) A very slow connection available in the device.
